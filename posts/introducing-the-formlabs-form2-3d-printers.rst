==================================================
Say hello to the newest 3D printers in the openlab
==================================================
The openlab is now home to 4 new SLA 3D printers. These are a great compliment to the `Lulzbot Taz 6 <https://www.lulzbot.com/store/printers/lulzbot-taz-6/>`_ FDM printers we brought into the lab last year.

The Problem
-----------

The Lulzbots are great for printing medium to large objects.  They can handle a wide variety of filament types, and are pretty quick printers.  However, a natural limitation and characteristic of FDM printers is that you can see small lines made as the printer deposits each layer of filament.  The lines can be filled, or sanded, but this takes time, and can 'soften' hard edges.  The size of the nozzle (.5mm) means that very small details don't look great, or might not print at all

Enter SLA
---------
SLA (short for Stereolithography), uses a light-cured liquid resin to build up the layers of the model.  Since it uses lasers, the resolution is much higher, making it possible to print smaller, more detailed models.  Take a look:
